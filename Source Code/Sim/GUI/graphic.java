/**
 * Interface for graphics on the network canvas. Sub classes should implement 
 * the methods as described. Required information for these methods, probably at
 * least some object from the simulation, should be provided to the sub class 
 * for instance through the constructor. To add a graphic to the network canvas
 * for painting, use <tt>jModelGUI.addBackdrop(graphic)</tt> or 
 * <tt>jModelGUI.addOverlay(graphic)</tt>.<br>
 * <br>
 * Within the implementation of the <tt>paint</tt> method, the network canvas is
 * supplied. This should only be used in two ways:<br>
 * 1) Use the size information to paint information on an absolute screen 
 * location (e.g. the upper left corner).<br>
 * 2) Use conveniance methods to supply colors and positions:<br>
 * <br>
 * - <tt>getPoint</tt> supplies the on-canvas point (in pixels) of a global
 * point. Use this to translate any global location to the point where it needs
 * to be painted. Do not worry about objects falling outside of the visible 
 * range, these are automatichally clipped (not drawn).<br>
 * - <tt>fromDefaultMap</tt> returns an interpolated color on the default color
 * map. The value extend of the map can be defined.<br>
 * - <tt>fromMap</tt> returns an interpolated color in a user defined map.<br>
 * - <tt>nToColor</tt> returns a distinct color for the values 1-18 and repeats
 * the colors for higher values.<br>
 * <br>
 * Note that the latter three are static methods which can be called on the
 * class instead of an object.
