    Talked to a low cost vendor. Discovered that IR Cameras won't look 
    through the forest canopy. Dropped Idea.

15th August, 2017 - Sunday

Found new Idea. Converting existing traffic management (traffic signals) into
one large ad-hoc network. Providing feedbacks to neighbouring signals to 
solve traffic congestion problems.

18th August, 2017 - Wednesday

Found some papers from IEEE about Ant Colony Optimization.

21st August, 2017 - Saturday

Found Base paper : arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02810.pdf
Found Important reference paper: www.complex-systems.com/pdf/16-1-2.pdf
Decided on Using MOTUS simulator. Decided usage of Image Processing and
Distributed Communication Protocols.

22nd August, 2017 - Sunday

Finalized a task list. Finalized a work flow.

Task list: 
    1) Contacted Arduino Expert - ****** *********
        Reply awaited.
    2) Sorted for Simulators.. Favourite = Motus, SUMO
    3) Sorted for papers.. Important = Complex-systems pdf.
    4) IDE and tools : Eclipse + Maven

Work flow:
    1) Research into OV7670 Camera Shield for Arduino.
    2) Research into using MOTUS Simulator.
    3) Research into cost and creation feasibility.

27th August, 2017 - Friday

Reevaluated Topic.. Looking to find issues in the problem itself.
